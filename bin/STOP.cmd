REM  SEO Tool - STOP
REM  Double-click this file to stop the running SEO Tool server.
REM  Safe to run even when the server is already stopped.
REM ============================================================
REM
REM Shutdown order (graceful -> hard):
REM   1. Try the saved PID with taskkill /T (no /F) so Node sees
REM      WM_CLOSE / Ctrl-Break and can flush data.db + close handles.
REM   2. Wait up to 5 seconds for the process to exit.
REM   3. Force-kill (/F /T) if it's still alive.
REM   4. Belt-and-suspenders: free anything bound to .seo-port.
REM   5. Clean up the .dev-server.cmd shim + the hidden cmd window
REM      that hosts the dev server (titled "Windows PowerShell").
