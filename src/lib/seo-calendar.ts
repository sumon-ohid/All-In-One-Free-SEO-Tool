/**
 * 30-day SEO calendar generator. Produces a deterministic plan based on:
 *
 *   - **Niche** (local / e-commerce / SaaS / blog / services)
 *   - **Tech stack** (WordPress / Shopify / Next.js etc.) — drives implementation hints
 *   - **Country & city** — drives citation directories, local rank focus
 *   - **GSC data** (when connected) — surfaces real quick wins + decay candidates
 *   - **Audit findings** (latest audit) — turns critical/high issues into early-week tasks
 *   - **GBP** — every client gets a baseline of GBP weekly tasks (review reply, post, photos)
 *
 * Output is ~30 daily task objects ready to insert into the tasks table.
 * Days mostly map to one focus area but balance technical / content / off-page
 * across the month so the user is never grinding the same thing all week.
