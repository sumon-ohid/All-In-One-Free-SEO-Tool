- Search-intent match (format the SERP demands)
- Topical authority (full-cluster coverage, not single posts)
- Page experience: Core Web Vitals (LCP ≤2.5s, INP ≤200ms, CLS ≤0.1), mobile-friendly, HTTPS
- Freshness (for queries that demand it)
- Internal linking depth + descriptive anchors
- Structured data (eligibility for rich results)
- Original research / data / experience

Experience: Author has actually used / done / experienced the thing. Real screenshots, photos, first-person language ("I ran 12 of these for 6 months"), original measurements.
Expertise: Credentials, years, specialism. Bio with verifiable facts. For YMYL, a reviewer line ("Medically reviewed by Dr. X").
Authoritativeness: External signals — citations, mentions, brand entity in the knowledge graph (Wikidata, Wikipedia, Crunchbase, sameAs schema).
Trust: HTTPS, contact page, About page, privacy policy, editorial policy, dates (published + updated), citations to authoritative sources (.gov / .edu / known publishers).

Concrete fixes that move E-E-A-T fastest:
1. Add author byline on every post → /author/<slug> page with bio + sameAs
2. Add Person + Organization schema with sameAs to LinkedIn, Twitter, Wikidata
3. Add "last-updated" dates to published posts; refresh + bump every 90-180 days

Coverage targets: ~15-30 pages per major cluster. Below that, you're not credibly an authority.

307 (temporary, preserves method) — for HTTPS upgrades / dev redirects.
308 (permanent, preserves method) — same as 301 but preserves POST/PUT — rarely needed for SEO.
410 (gone) — use INSTEAD of 404 when content is intentionally deleted with no replacement.

Anti-patterns:
- Redirect chains (A→B→C). Browser still gets there but each hop loses some equity. Aim for 1 hop.
- Redirecting all 404s to homepage. Google considers this a "soft 404" and will eventually treat the homepage as low-quality. Redirect only when there's a relevant target; otherwise serve 410.

- Match search intent. Listicle queries → "Best 9 X for Y", how-to queries → "How to X (step-by-step)"
- Don't keyword-stuff — Google rewrites
- Skip pipes when title is short; use dashes for tight separators
- Consider year/version: "(2026)" or "(updated)" — bumps CTR ~3-7% for review queries

- Lead with what the page delivers (not what the page is)

- subdomain (de.example.com, fr.example.com): medium signal, easier hosting, link equity still split
- subdirectory (example.com/de/, example.com/fr/): weakest geo signal, easiest, link equity unified

Most modern sites use subdirectories — the hreflang annotations carry the geo-targeting signal, and unified link equity is more valuable than the geo signal.

hreflang rules:
- Every alternate must reference every other (reciprocity)
- Every page references itself (self-reference)
- Always include x-default for fallback
- Format: language-region (en-US, en-GB, fr-FR) — ISO 639-1 + ISO 3166-1
- Don't mix country and language: en-AU is fine; en alone is also fine; en-spanish is broken

Implementation: HTML head OR HTTP header OR sitemap. Pick one and stick with it. /tools/hreflang-gen emits all three formats.

Common bugs:
- Self-reference missing
- Reciprocal pair broken (page A says B but B doesn't say A)
- x-default missing
- Wrong language code (en_US instead of en-US)

Why they differ:
- GSC measures Google-side: every click on your result. No bots / direct.
- GA4 measures site-side: every session that loaded a tracking pixel. Filters out bots; misses ad-blocked users (10-30% loss).
- GSC double-counts when same user clicks twice (back to SERP, click again).
- GA4 starts session timer on landing — multi-tab opens count as 1 session.
- Tracking gaps: privacy plugins, consent rejection, page-bounce-before-script-loads.

Typical relationship: GSC clicks ≈ GA4 organic sessions × 1.1-1.3.

Which to use for what:
- Rankings, queries, impressions, CTR → GSC
- On-site behavior, conversions, revenue → GA4
- Branded vs non-branded split → GSC (use brand-terms classifier)
- AIO citation tracking → GSC (look for clicks dropping while impressions stay flat — classic AIO pattern)

People-first checks (must answer YES):

- Does it provide insightful analysis or interesting information beyond the obvious?
- If drawing on other sources, does it add substantial value rather than copying or rewriting?
- Does the main heading or page title provide a descriptive, helpful summary of the content (NOT clickbait)?
- Would users want to bookmark, share, or recommend it?
- Would the content be referenced in a print magazine/encyclopedia/book?
- Does it provide substantial value when compared to other pages in search results?
- Is it free of spelling/stylistic issues?
- Was it well-produced (not appearing sloppy or hastily produced)?
- Is it not mass-produced by or outsourced to a large number of creators?

Avoid (search-engine-first signals that get demoted):
- Content made primarily to attract visitors from search engines
- Using extensive automation to produce content on many topics
- Mainly summarizing what others have to say without much value added
- Writing about things just because they're trending, not your real expertise
- Promises content that doesn't deliver (e.g. "release date for X" when no date exists)
- Writing to a specific word count because you heard Google prefers a specific count

1. Site Reputation Abuse policy got teeth (expanded Nov 2025, enforced March 2026)
   - Google now algorithmically detects sections "starkly different" from main site content
   - When detected, that section is treated as a separate entity — parent domain authority does NOT pass
   - Trigger: third-party content (affiliates, partners, outsourced SEO firms) on sections like /coupons/, /reviews/, /deals/
   - Fix: re-establish first-party editorial oversight (named in-house editor + bylines on every piece) OR move the section to a subdomain you don't want to inherit authority from

2. Rich result retirements / reductions
   - FAQ rich result rarely shown (now only on authoritative health/finance sites)
   - HowTo rich result fully retired for most queries
   - Review snippet narrowed (only on the page being primarily about the review)
   - Schema is still valid + helps AI Mode entity verification, but stop expecting SERP display

3. AI Mode + AI Overviews integration deepened
   - Schema now feeds AI Mode entity verification heavily; Article + Person schema is the new floor
   - Author E-E-A-T signals (bio + Person schema + sameAs) more important than ever
   - Content scoring 8.5+ on semantic completeness is 4.2× more likely to be AIO-cited

1. Clear, concise answers — write content that directly answers user questions in a single, complete passage. Lead with the answer; explanations come after.

2. Strong entity relationships — make it crystal clear which entity (brand, product, person) the page is about. Use Schema.org Organization / Product / Person markup with sameAs linking to authoritative profiles (Wikipedia, Crunchbase, LinkedIn, IMDB).

3. Authoritative signals — author bio with credentials, citations to primary sources, dateModified, reviewer line, and a clear About / Editorial Policy page.

Practical pattern that works:
- Each H2 section opens with a 134-167 word self-contained passage that fully answers a related sub-question
- The opening sentence is a direct definition or statement of fact ("INP measures …" not "Let's talk about INP …")
- Include one concrete number or proper noun per ~250 words
- Cite ≥2 authoritative outbound sources
- Author byline + embedded Person JSON-LD in Article schema
- Visible last-updated date matching dateModified

- Author has authored ≥3 articles on the topic (topical authority — "real people who write about real things they know")
- For YMYL (health/finance/safety): credentials matter heavily — degrees, certifications, professional memberships

Anti-patterns that hurt:
- "Staff" or "Admin" bylines
- Pseudonyms without verifiable identity
- Stock photo headshots
- Author with one post, never seen again ("article mill" pattern)
- Author page that's just a name + role with no bio

For multi-author sites: every author needs a real bio page with sameAs to their public profiles. AI Mode citation correlates strongly with how complete the author entity is.

Implementation: use the Person schema generator. Pair every Article schema with an embedded author Person object, not a separate top-level Person.

2. Schema.org image property (Article, Product, Recipe, etc.)
3. First in-content image that meets minimum size (1200×630+ recommended for Discover)

When the three disagree, Google may pick the wrong one. Best practice:
- Set og:image to the canonical share image at 1200×630
- Set schema.org image to the same URL OR a higher-res version (2400×1260 for retina Discover)
- Use the same image as the first prominent in-page <img>

Other 2026 image SEO essentials:
- Filename: hyphen-separated keywords ("red-running-shoes.webp" not "IMG_4521.jpg")
- Alt text: describe the image's content + context (5-15 words). Skip alt only for purely decorative images.
- Width/height attributes on every <img> (CLS prevention — now a CWV signal)
- loading="lazy" on below-fold; "eager" on LCP image
- WebP or AVIF preferred over JPEG/PNG; the size win is 25-50%
- For products: include Product schema with image property
- For e-commerce: an image sitemap submitted via robots.txt or GSC

What Google does:
- HTML fetch → indexer queue → renderer queue → final HTML used for indexing
- Renderer queue can have delays (hours to days) under load
- JS-rendered content is indexed, but later than static HTML

What AI crawlers (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, CCBot) do:
- Fetch static HTML only — no JS execution
- See whatever your server returns before any client-side rendering
- AppleBot and Googlebot are the ONLY major crawlers that render JS

Implication: if your React/Next.js app ships an empty body and renders client-side, AI crawlers see a blank page. You're invisible in ChatGPT, Perplexity, AI Overviews.

Fix priority (ordered by impact):
1. Server-render the critical content. In Next.js: use Server Components (default in App Router), avoid 'use client' on the main content tree.
2. Use generateStaticParams + force-static for pages that don't need real-time data.
3. If you MUST stay CSR: prerender a meaningful static snapshot (next export, gatsby, react-snap, prerender.io).
4. Test what crawlers see: curl -A 'GPTBot' YOUR_URL | grep MAIN_HEADING — if missing, you're invisible.

Hydration errors cause Google to use the unhydrated HTML. Console errors in production hurt SEO.

Six pillars of the modern authority signal:
1. Branded search volume — people typing your brand into Google. The single strongest indicator Google can't fake.
2. Entity completeness — Knowledge Panel + Wikipedia + Wikidata + structured sameAs across 10+ profiles.
3. Quality citations — links from sites that are themselves authoritative (Wikipedia, .edu, .gov, major publications).
4. Mention velocity — frequency of unlinked brand mentions across the open web (Reddit, Twitter/X, niche forums, news).
5. Author signals — named experts publishing across the topic cluster (E-E-A-T at scale).
6. Engagement signals — return visits, brand-name navigational queries, GA4 engagement rate, low pogo-sticking.

Practical implications:
- Branded search volume is built by everything else: PR, podcasts, Reddit AMAs, YouTube appearances, conference talks. Track it in GSC as a leading indicator.
- One Wikipedia mention is worth more than 100 directory links.
- Earning unlinked mentions counts — set up brand-mention monitoring (we have /brand-monitor) and convert them to links over time.

Weights (sum to 100):
- 25% Citability — does content read as cite-ready 134-167 word self-contained passages with definitions, numbers, sources? Score via /tools/aio-passage.
- 20% Brand authority — branded search volume, Knowledge Panel completeness, sameAs density, Wikipedia presence. Score via /brand-serp + /knowledge-panel.
- 20% Content quality / E-E-A-T — author bio + Person schema + first-hand experience markers + cited sources. Score via /tools/eeat-audit.
- 15% Technical foundation — SSR (not CSR), Core Web Vitals pass, indexability, schema correctness. Score via /tools/health-check + /tools/crux-origin.
- 10% Schema / structured data — Article + Organization + Person + correct LocalBusiness/Product as applicable. Score via /tools/schema-validate.
- 10% Platform-specific tactics — Reddit presence for Perplexity, Wikipedia for ChatGPT, official docs for Claude, schema for Gemini. Score via /tools/ai-citation-tactics.

A site scoring 70+ is highly likely to be cited in AI Overviews / ChatGPT / Perplexity. <40 = invisible. The composite hides nothing — it forces you to address the weakest leg first.

    body: `SXO blends SEO with UX: "rank for the query AND satisfy the user once they land." Google's helpful-content systems now weight engagement signals heavily (return visits, dwell time, brand-name navigational queries, low pogo-sticking).

The SXO loop:
1. Persona — for each top-traffic URL, define the 1-2 personas typing those queries. What's their actual job? What did they try before searching?
2. Intent depth — map their query to the deepest underlying need (informational / navigational / commercial / transactional / "I'm stuck and frustrated").
3. Page promise — does the H1 + first paragraph deliver on the snippet they clicked? If not, they bounce.
4. Time-to-answer — can the user find the answer in <30 seconds? If not, hoist the TL;DR above all else.
5. Next step — every page must offer a clear next action. Dead ends pogo-stick.
6. Friction audit — pop-ups, cookie banners, intrusive interstitials, slow LCP, layout shift. Every friction point hurts engagement.

What to measure:
- GA4 engagement rate per landing page
- Scroll depth (>75% = high engagement)
- Return visitors from organic
- "Brand + topic" navigational queries growing month-over-month
- Pogo-stick rate (rare metric — proxy via average position vs CTR vs engagement)

This is where SEO and conversion-rate-optimization converge. In 2026, the highest-ranking page is no longer "the page with the most backlinks" — it's the one users actually engage with.`,

    body: `A Content Attack Brief is a focused content brief targeting a SPECIFIC competitor weakness — not a topic you "should" cover. The framing forces sharper prioritization.

How to find attack opportunities:
1. Pull a competitor's top 100 ranking keywords (use /content-gap if you have GSC for both sides).
2. Filter to keywords where: competitor ranks 4-15 (vulnerable, not entrenched at #1), search volume ≥50/mo, and the SERP doesn't have an immovable Wikipedia/Reddit result.
3. For each, check if YOUR site has any related page. If yes → add to a content-refresh queue. If no → attack candidate.
4. Sort by: (estimated traffic value × competitor weakness) ÷ (content production cost).

What goes in an Attack Brief:
- Target keyword + 3-5 supporting keywords
- Competitor URL ranking now + why it's beatable (thin content, outdated date, no author, no schema, missing PAA coverage)
- Search intent classification
- Target word count (match SERP median + 10%)
- Required E-E-A-T signals (named author, citations, first-hand example)
- Required schema (Article + Person + FAQ if intent calls for it)
- Internal-link targets to/from the new page
- AIO passage candidates (the 134-167 word chunks designed to be cited)
- Definition of done: ranks top-10 within 60 days OR retire

Anti-pattern: writing 100 attack briefs and finishing none. Cap WIP at 5.`,

- GPTBot (OpenAI training)
- ChatGPT-User (OpenAI live retrieval for ChatGPT Search)
- OAI-SearchBot (OpenAI search index)
- ClaudeBot (Anthropic — combined training + retrieval)
- anthropic-ai (legacy Anthropic identifier — block both for safety)
- PerplexityBot (Perplexity retrieval)
- Perplexity-User (Perplexity user-agent for one-off retrieval)
- Google-Extended (Google generative AI training, separate from Googlebot)
- Googlebot — DO NOT block; that's classic Search
- CCBot (Common Crawl — feeds most LLM training sets)
- Amazonbot (Alexa + Q)
- Applebot (Siri + Spotlight — DO NOT block)
- Applebot-Extended (Apple generative AI training)
- Bytespider (TikTok / ByteDance)

The two-policy pattern most brands now adopt:
- Allow AI retrieval crawlers (Perplexity-User, ChatGPT-User, ClaudeBot for retrieval) — you want to be cited
- Block AI training crawlers (GPTBot, Google-Extended, Anthropic, CCBot) — you don't want to train competitors' models on your content for free

User-agent: GPTBot

User-agent: CCBot
Disallow: /

User-agent: PerplexityBot

    body: `Hard data from 2026 citation studies: only ~11% of cited domains overlap between ChatGPT and Perplexity. Brand mentions correlate ~3x more strongly with AI citation than backlinks do. Tailor effort per platform — don't optimize once for "AI search" generically.

ChatGPT (largest LLM by user count, conservative citation graph):
- #1: Wikipedia mention. A single notable-mention link compounds for years.
- #2: Major-publication mention (Forbes, BBC, NYT, TechCrunch). One per quarter moves the needle.
- #3: Inclusion in "best of" evergreen listicles ranking on Google page 1.
- Reddit matters but less than for Perplexity.

Perplexity (fastest-growing search-style LLM):
- Reddit is 46.7% of top citations. Multi-month presence in 2-3 niche subreddits with genuinely helpful comments.
- YouTube is ~14%. A single well-ranked tutorial drives citations for months.
- Auto-generated captions weight lower than human-written.
- Comparison pages ("X vs Y") with honest tables rank well.

Claude (smaller but high-influence audience):
- Official documentation cited heavily — clean /docs with semantic HTML.
- GitHub repos. Even a small open-source artifact compounds.
- Wikipedia (same play as ChatGPT).
- Primary research / surveys / benchmarks (cite-able primary sources).

Gemini / Google AI Mode:
- Just rank in classic Google — Gemini pulls overwhelmingly from top 10.
- Article + Person schema (entity verification).
- Visible dateModified (freshness).
- Structured answer formats (tables, definition lists, numbered steps).

Google AI Overviews (47% of commercial queries trigger AIO):
- 134-167 word self-contained passages.
- Open each H2 with a direct definition.
- Specific number or proper noun per ~250 words.
- Person schema embedded in Article schema.
- AIO citation earns 35% more clicks than the typical top-3 result.

The takeaway: AI search visibility is N parallel campaigns, not one. Pick the 2-3 platforms your ICP actually uses and over-invest there.`,

When this play works:
- SaaS / B2B services with active competitive market
- E-commerce with clear competitor sets
- Tools with obvious head-to-head categories

When it doesn't:
- Single-vendor categories (you're the only option)
- Highly fragmented markets (no dominant competitor to attack)
- Markets where comparison is a legal/compliance minefield

How to write the page:
1. Be ruthlessly honest — no straw-man competitor. Users have used both; they smell BS.
2. Lead with a 1-line summary: "[Your brand] is X-for-Y; [Competitor] is Z-for-W. If you need X, pick us. If you need Z, pick them."
3. Comparison table with rows the BUYER actually cares about (price, integrations, support, specific features). Not your marketing wish-list.
4. Include scenarios where the competitor is genuinely better. This earns trust + builds defensibility — you're not afraid of the comparison.
5. Strong CTAs to free trial / demo. High-intent traffic deserves a fast next step.
6. Schema: Product schema for your offering, mentioning competitor by name is fine — Google doesn't penalize naming.
7. SEO: target "[competitor] alternatives", "[competitor] vs [you]", "best [category]" with appropriate variations.

What to AVOID:
- Trademark/trade-dress violation in copy
- Negative campaigning that reads as smear
- Out-of-date competitor info — keep these pages fresh quarterly
- Targeting "[competitor] login" or "[competitor] coupon" — that's misappropriation`,

- H1 + H2/H3 outline
- Word count (±15% triggers alert)
- Schema types + key fields (Article author, Product price, etc.)
- Canonical URL
- robots / X-Robots-Tag
- HTTP status + redirect chain
- Image alt-text coverage %
- Internal link count to/from this page

Signals to baseline (per site):
- robots.txt content (we already do this)
- sitemap.xml content + lastmod entries
- Total indexable page count (from GSC)
- Average rank for top 20 keywords (we have keyword tracking)
- Core Web Vitals origin-level p75 (we have CrUX)

Alert thresholds (start conservative, tune):
- Title changed → alert always
- Meta description changed → alert
- H1 changed → alert
- Canonical points away when it didn't before → critical alert
- noindex appeared on a previously-indexed page → critical alert
- Word count dropped >20% → alert
- Schema validation went from ok → error → alert

Frequency: weekly for content; daily for technical (canonical, noindex, robots, sitemap). The cost is tiny; the value is catching a broken deploy before it costs you a month of rankings.
