## 💰 How much you save

A typical SEO professional pays **₹25,000-₹45,000 per month** ($300-$540) for tools. This one replaces all of them — for ₹0.

### Solo freelancer SEO stack (real prices, 2026)

| Tool you're paying for | What it does | Cost / month |
|---|---|---|
| Semrush Pro | Keyword research, rank tracking, audits | **₹11,700** ($140) |
| Surfer SEO Essential | Content briefs, content score | **₹7,400** ($89) |
| BrightLocal Single | Local SEO, citation tracking | **₹3,300** ($39) |
| Frase | AI content writer | **₹3,800** ($45) |
| ChatGPT Plus | AI assistant | **₹1,700** ($20) |
| **TOTAL** |  | **₹27,900 / month** |
| | | **₹3.35 lakh / year** |
| **This tool replaces all 5** | | **₹0 / month** ✅ |

### Small agency stack

| Tool | Cost / month |
|---|---|
| Ahrefs Lite | **₹10,800** ($129) |
| Semrush Pro | **₹11,700** ($140) |
| Surfer SEO Advanced | **₹18,300** ($219) |
| BrightLocal Multi | **₹6,600** ($79) |
| Frase Team | **₹9,600** ($115) |
| Reporting tool (AgencyAnalytics) | **₹6,300** ($75) |
| **TOTAL** | **₹63,300 / month** |
| | **₹7.6 lakh / year** |
| **This tool replaces all 6** | **₹0 / month** ✅ |

> *Prices accurate as of February 2026. Ahrefs / Semrush / Surfer publish official pricing on their sites — what you actually pay can be higher with add-ons (extra users, extra projects, AI credits).*

> **You're not paying for the data.** Google gives away the same data through their free APIs (Search Console, Analytics, PageSpeed, Trends, autocomplete). Ahrefs and Semrush charge you ₹10,000+/month to repackage what's already free. This tool just connects directly to the free sources.

---

## ⚡ Install in one command

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Is this really free?</strong></summary>

Yes — fully self-hostable under the [PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0](LICENSE) license. No usage limits, no feature gates, no telemetry. You can use it for personal SEO, paid freelance client work, or running an agency — all free. The only restriction is you can't sell the software itself or run it as a paid SaaS without a [commercial license](#-license).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does it work without paid API keys?</strong></summary>

The tool ships with a headless Chromium browser pool that scrapes Google, DuckDuckGo, and Bing for SERPs, autocomplete, related searches, and rank checks. Adding free Google API keys (GSC, GA4, PageSpeed — all free tiers, no credit card) makes it faster and more accurate, but isn't required.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use this for client work as a freelancer or agency?</strong></summary>

Yes. Charging clients for your SEO services using this tool is completely allowed — that's not "selling the software," it's selling your service. You can white-label reports with your own brand, run it on your own infrastructure, and bill clients however you want.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does it compare to Ahrefs / Semrush?</strong></summary>

Ahrefs and Semrush have larger backlink indexes and pay for premium SERP APIs at scale. This tool uses free Google APIs + headless browsers, which is slower at huge scale but free forever. For SEOs managing 1-25 client websites, the difference rarely matters — and you'll save ₹3-7 lakh/year ($3,000-$7,000).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does it run on a $5/month VPS?</strong></summary>

Yes. Tested on Hetzner CX11 (1 GB RAM). Daily agent + 5 clients with full rank tracking fits comfortably. The headless browser pool is the dominant resource — disable it in Settings if you only need audits + content tools.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I run this fully offline?</strong></summary>

Yes. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) for local AI (Llama 3.2 / Phi-3 / Mistral). SERP scraping and Google API calls still need internet, but everything else — audits, content, schema, internal linking, reports — runs offline.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is data stored?</strong></summary>

A single `data.db` SQLite file in your install folder. API keys and OAuth tokens are encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM. Backup = copy the folder. Migrate machines = copy the folder.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What about SEO Panel / SerpBear / SEOnaut / RustySEO?</strong></summary>

This tool absorbs the best ideas from each: SEO Panel's multi-client + white-label, SerpBear's rank tracking + GSC integration, SEOnaut's severity-classified audits, RustySEO's local AI + log analysis. Plus genuinely new pieces no other open-source tool has: LLM-citation tracking, ad-funnel architect, content decay detector, niche-aware task templates, tech-stack-aware recommendations.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does it support non-English sites?</strong></summary>

Yes. Audits and rank tracking work for any country and language (country + BCP-47 language stored per client). Content generation respects the configured language. UI is English-only for now — translations welcome via PR.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What if my CMS isn't supported?</strong></summary>

The tool detects 2,500+ technologies via Wappalyzer. Tech-stack-aware recommendations exist for WordPress, Shopify, Next.js, Webflow, Wix, Squarespace, Laravel, custom PHP, and ~20 more. For anything else, you get generic recommendations + a "give my developer instructions" button that generates a clear ticket.
</details>

## 👋 Who built this?

**Built solo by [Prince Ramgarhia](https://github.com/IamRamgarhia) (DiceCodes)** — a full-stack developer based in Punjab, India, building products end-to-end.

This SEO platform exists because every existing tool either costs ₹10,000+/month or has critical gaps (no AI-search tracking, no integrated workflow, dated UI). Rather than pick one, I built the integrated tool I wanted as a freelance SEO myself: modern stack, free-first, privacy-first, tech-stack-aware.

**Other shipped work:**
- 🌐 [dicecodes.com](https://dicecodes.com) — portfolio + past projects
- 🧾 [Free GST Billing Software](https://github.com/IamRamgarhia/Free-GST-Billing-Software) — open-source invoicing for Indian small businesses

**Why trust a solo project over established SaaS?**
- The full source is here — read it, audit it, fork it
- Issues + PRs get a same-week response (solo dev = no support-tier roulette)
- License (PolyForm Noncommercial) legally guarantees the tool stays free for end users forever — even if DiceCodes vanishes tomorrow, anyone can continue it

**Want to hire the builder for your own product?** See [Need custom software?](#-need-custom-software-like-this-we-build-it) below.
